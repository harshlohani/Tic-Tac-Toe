# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project i have created a simple game of tic tac toe which can be played between 2 player .
In this game, the players will be asked for their names as input, and the winner and loser will be decided on the basis of winning conditions and if the conditions are not fulfilled the game is to be declared as a 'Tie'.
The game makes the use of importing modules(name-import.py) and making use of __name__ == “main” so that the main function( or the game) is only executed when the file is being executed as main file.
